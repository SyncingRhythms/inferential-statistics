Stats mini-projects

This is growing collection of notebooks where I examine a variety of hypotheses utilizing statistical inference techniques including, confidence intervals, margin of error, and hypyothesis testing with z-tests, t-tests, and chi-square tests. For results, open notebooks.

1. testing_normal_body_temp.ipynb
- test the generally accepted mean humany body temperature of 98.6 deg
- assess whether male vs. female temperature differences exist in the current dataset, from a 1992 [article](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/normtemp.txt)

2. racial_impact_resumes.ipynb
- compare proportions of call backs received for identical resumes that were labeled with white- or black-sounding names
- use chi-square test to determine if these proportions varied from those expected in general
- data from an [experiment](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/discrimination-job-market-united-states) on racial discrimination in the job market

3. hospital_readmission_rates.ipnb
- critique existing analysis and data visualizations
- conducted more sound analysis and informative data visualizations
- examine proportions of excessive readmission rates (>1) for hospitals varying in capacity
- chi-square test
- open-source U.S. goverment healthcare [data](https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-Readmissions-Reduction-Program/9n3s-kdb3)
